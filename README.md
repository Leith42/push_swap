# push_swap
42 Project.

* In this project, we were given a sequence of numbers via command line
  arguments and had to parse the input into a stack of numbers, stack A.
* We were also given a series of operations: swap a given stack's top values,
  swap both stacks' top values, push onto stack A, push onto stack B, rotate or
  reverse rotate A and/or B.
* Given these limited number of operations, and only ONE other empty stack,
  stack B, we had to sort stack A in ascending order
